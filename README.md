# [Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE)](http://uxd-rcue.rhcloud.com) reference implementation

The Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE) project was created to promote design commonality across all of Red Hatâ€™s Enterprise product offerings.

This reference implementation of RCUE is based on [Bootstrap v3.0.1](http://getbootstrap.com/); therefore, [Bootstrap v3.0.1](http://getbootstrap.com/) is required in order for it to work properly.

## Development

Development setup requires nodejs. If you do not already have nodejs and npm installed on your system, please see https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager for how to install on your distribution.

### Install Bower Components

After ensuring nodejs and npm are available, install [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally:

    npm install -g bower

Now that bower is available, we can install the required development components:

    bower install

At this point, you should now have a top level components/ folder with all dependencies listed in the bower.json file installed.

### Install Development Dependencies

The development includes the use of a number of helpful tasks. In order to setup your development environment to allow running of these tasks, you need to install the local nodejs packages declared in `package.json`. To do this run:

    npm install

This will install all necessary development packages into `node_modules/`. At this point, the gruntjs tasks are available for use such as starting a local development server or building the master CSS file.

### Live Reload Server

A local development server can be quickly fired up by using the Gruntjs server task:

    grunt server

This local static asset server has the advantage of having livereload integration. Thus, if you start the Gruntjs server, any changes you make to `.html` or `.less` files will be automatically reloaded into your browser and the changes reflected almost immediately. This has the obvious benefit of not having to refresh your browser and still be able to see the changes as you add or remove them from your development files.

## Build

### CSS

In development, styling is written and managed through multiple lesscss files. In order to generate a CSS file of all styling, run the build Gruntjs task:

    grunt build

This task will compile and minify the lesscss files into a single CSS file located at `dist/rcue.css`.
